## 💻 Running the Application

### 1️⃣ Development Mode with Local Storage (No Backend)

For development without a backend server, using local storage:

```bash
npm run dev:local
```

This will start the application on:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

### 2️⃣ Development Mode with Backend Server

If you have the backend server running, use:

```bash
npm run dev
```

By default, the frontend expects the backend API to be available at:

```
http://localhost:3030/api
```
