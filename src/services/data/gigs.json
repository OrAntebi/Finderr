    "description": "Thank you for stopping by! This gig is intended for anyone who is looking for a well rounded and undefined design for their company or brand. We will try different concepts and ideas to get you where you need to be. If you aren't sure where to start, this is a good gig to choose Unlike a lot of other fiverr artists, my designs do not change in quality depending upon what package you choose. All of my designs deserve the same attention and quality guarantee. My process starts in the traditional form which means I begin with paper and pencil. Once that is complete I refine it with art and/or calligraphy pens. Once that's complete, I bring it into my computer and render it digitally. The colors can be whatever you choose and the packages are all different. So please read them carefully or send me a message if you have any questions",

We will try different concepts and ideas to get you where you need to be. If you aren't sure where to start, this is a good gig to choose Unlike a lot of other fiverr artists, my designs do not change in quality depending upon what package you choose. All of my designs deserve the same attention and quality guarantee. My process starts in the traditional form which means I begin with paper and pencil. Once that is complete I refine it with art and/or calligraphy pens. Once that's complete, I bring it into my computer and render it digitally. The colors can be whatever you choose and the packages are all different. So please read them carefully or send me a message if you have any questions",

You will be involved in the creation process, and I will make a basic edition of the result if needed. Remember, there are limitations in the AI (no blood, no NSFW content, similar face generation, etc.), so if possible, I can help by making a few basic touches and changes to get the desired image.\n    Order now and let's make your concept a reality. Remember to ask any question you want before placing an order, that way I can start right away.\n    IMPORTANT: Midjourney AI won't give you an exact representation of your face, which is important to know beforehand.

All of my designs deserve the same attention and quality guarantee. My process starts in the traditional form which means I begin with paper and pencil. Once that is complete I refine it with art and/or calligraphy pens. Once that's complete, I bring it into my computer and render it digitally. The colors can be whatever you choose and the packages are all different. So please read them carefully or send me a message if you have any questions",
